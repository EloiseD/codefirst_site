    <h4><strong>Synopsis</strong></h4>
    <p><i>Roma</i> is made up of a number of seemingly unrelated sequences, including Fellini's childhood, his move to Rome as a young man and wartime experience. These are mixed with present-day sequences that blend fantasy and reality, such as the Ecclesiastical fashion show (see below). </p>
